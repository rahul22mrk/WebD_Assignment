                <p class="content ">This film is…this film is…kind of…exactly what you imagine a Coen Brothers fever dream might look like? I feel like the marketing for it made it seem as though it were a straight send-up of old-Hollywood, when studios ran every detail
                    of an actor’s life. And…it is.

                    I should point out at this point, I am a giant slut for Marvel. I will pretty much see anything with the Marvel name on it. This is not to say I won’t be fair to their films.

                <p class="content ">This is not to say it’s a masterpiece. CGI – ehh, you’ve seen it before. Movie Physics are in full play as buses flip, bodies are tossed into concrete and hit metal with no more need to shrug it off than if you had a papercut.
